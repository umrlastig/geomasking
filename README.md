# geomasking
Python libraries for geomasking (or spatial anonymization). The repository contains implementations of the following methods:
- aggregation to given cells (can be blocks, census units, regular grids, etc.)
- bimodal Gaussian perturbation
- Adaptive Areal Masking from (Kounadi & Leitner, 2016)
- Simulated Cluster Crowding

The implementation uses Shapely to deal with geometry computation.
